# Mazdamundi
Temple Guards was my choice for Mazdamundi, Hunting Pack units are supposed to improve damage output of the army and can be used as flanking shooters.
## Stage 1
  * Temple Guards
    * +2 Melee Defence
  * Hunting Pack Units
    * +5% Range
## Stage 2
  * Temple Guards
    * +5 Melee Defence
    * +5% Physical Resistance
    * +15% Fire Resistance
  * Hunting Pack Units
    * +10% Range
## Stage 3
  * Temple Guards
    * +10 Melee Defence
    * +15% Physical Resistance
    * +30% Fire Resistance
  * Hunting Pack Units
    * +20% Range
    * Enable Stalk
    * Enable Unspottable
  * Salamander Hunting Pack
    * Improve Explosion Damage and Enable AP Projectile
  * Razordon Hunting Pack
    * Increase Anti-large bonus for Projectile and Enable AP Projectile

# Gor-Rok
Saurus Warriors are more than capable even in the late game, their problem lies in their utility. Melee Infantry tends to take heavy casualty from enemy missiles and spells, which is the reason I gave them "Shield of Quetzl" (Yeah F U Skaven Weapon Teams), the minus in melee attack will hopefully stop players from spamming this ability off cooldown. The reason I gave them "Apex Predator" is I had battles where my saurus units chase behind enemy missile units for like 10 minutes, I can't catch them and they can't do any damage to me. "Apex Predator" should be able to help them run down enemies that are fleeing from them.
## Stage 1
  * Saurus Units
    * +10 Armour
## Stage 2
  * Saurus Unirs
    * +20 Armour
    * Enable "Apex Predator" Ability (Increase Movement Speed by 40% when there is hostile unit within 70 range, recovers 18% Fatigue when this ability is triggered)
## Stage 3
  * Saurus Unirs
    * +40 Armour
    * Enable "Apex Predator" Ability (Increase Movement Speed by 40% when there is hostile unit within 70 range, recovers 18% Fatigue when this ability is triggered)
    * Enable "Shield of Quetzl" Ability (+30% Missile Resistance, +30% Magic Resistance, -7 Melee Attack. Duration 15s, Recharge Time 90s)

# Kroq-Gar
Kroq-Gar got Cold Ones since he himself has a fast mount unlike Gor-Rok. I personally didn't quite understood why beasts living in the jungle got a penalty when fighting in forests so I gave them Strider. "Cold-Blooded" for every single unit should make sure that players can keep control over all their units.
## Stage 1
  * Cold One Units (Include Horned Ones)
    * +5% Physical Resistance
    * +5 Charge Bonus
## Stage 2
  * Cold One Units (Include Horned Ones)
    * +10% Physical Resistance
    * +10 Charge Bonus
## Stage 3
  * Cold One Units (Include Horned Ones)
    * +20% Physical Resistance
    * +20 Charge Bonus
    * Enable Strider
    * Enable "Cold Blooded" Ability

# Tehenhauin
Skinks are still squishy, but they can now isolate enemy units with the help from "Snare of Sotek" and deal massive amount of damage to them. Chameleon Skinks are also very good at sneaking through the battle field and destory enemy artillery units.
## Stage 1
  * All Skink Units
    * +5% Speed
  * Skink Skirmisher and Chameleon Skink
    * +10% Range
  * Skink Cohort and Red Crested Skink

  * Skink Skirmisher and Chameleon Skink
    * +30% Range
    * Enable Unspottable
    * Enable AP Projectile
  * Skink Cohort and Red Crested Skink
    * +40% Weapon Strength

# Nakai
Kroxigors are actually pretty decent, gave them a bit more to match the power of a stegadon doom stack.

    * +10% Speed

# Tiktaq'to
All 3 Stages will make Tiktaq'to's whole army to become Unbreakable so a pure air unit army is possible. (Without this effect you just have to bring a stalking Stegadon, which makes no sense at all)
